# pallet-example-sysexts
A Forklift pallet demonstrating the use of Forklift to manage systemd system extensions

## Introduction

pallet-example-sysexts is a [Forklift](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift) pallet
specifying an example set of Forklift packages and package deployments for a deep demonstration of
a variety of different kinds of file exports of
[systemd sysexts/confexts](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-sysext.html)
to overlay into the OS.

For simplicity, this pallet is structured as a monorepo in which all packages to be deployed are
also defined by the pallet (because this Git repo is declared as both a Forklift pallet and a
Forklift package repository).

## Usage

This pallet is meant to be used together with
[ethanjli/ublue-forklift-sysext-demo](https://github.com/ethanjli/ublue-forklift-sysext-demo)
as the host OS; for a step-by-step demonstration of the usage of this pallet, follow the
[usage guide of ethanjli/ublue-forklift-sysext-demo](https://github.com/ethanjli/ublue-forklift-sysext-demo/?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).

### Forking

To make your own copy of this repository for experimentation, you should fork this repository to a
new repository. Then, update the `path` fields of the `forklift-pallet.yml` and
`forklift-repository.yml` files to match the path of your new repository.
